    <h3>House Blend Coffee</h3>
    <img src="./images/coffe1.png" alt="blend coffee">
    <p>House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker. That is what makes them so unique
    and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the roaster and/or distributor.
    For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The
    one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and
    delicious cup of coffee, period.”</p>
