    <h2>About us!!!</h2>
    
    <p>We are the parent company of the Coffee Day Group, which houses Café Coffee Day that pioneered the coffee culture in the
    chained café segment in India. This coffee goes all over the world to clients across, Europe and Japan, making us one of
    the top coffee exporters in the country. We opened our first Café Coffee Day outlet in Bengaluru in 1996 , ours was a
    new vision—one where coffee was more than just a beverage. It was a cup that brought coffee aficionados, budding coffee
    drinkers, and well, friends together over a cup of freshly brewed coffee. Today, our subsidiary Coffee Day Global
    Limited has established the largest footprint of café outlets in India-spread across more than 200 cities. Our forays
    into diverse businesses are marked by the same passion with which we started Coffee Day Global Limited. Our portfolio
    includes Technology Parks & SEZs, Logistics, Investments, Financial Services and Hospitality.
    
    Our Company was originally formed as a partnership firm constituted under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 on February
    1, 2008 under the name Coffeeday Holding Co. Coffeeday Holding Co. was thereafter converted from a partnership firm to a
    private limited company under Part IX of the Companies Act, 1956 as Coffee Day Holdings Company Private Limited. The
    name of our Company was changed to Coffee Day Resorts Private Limited and subsequently, as Coffee Day Enterprises
    Private Limited. Our Company was converted into a public limited company and the name of our Company was changed to
    Coffee Day Enterprises Limited thereafter.</p>
